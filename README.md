# üêæ Animal Species Detection

An **Animal Species Recognition and Classification** project aims to create an artificial intelligence-based system that recognizes and classifies the images of various animal species using computer vision and machine learning techniques.

This project can be used as a potential tool, particularly in biological and environmental research, to detect and monitor the presence of animals in their natural habitats. Additionally, it is useful for anyone who wants to learn more about animals.

The project starts with collecting images of many different animal species and identifying their characteristics. A machine learning model is then trained using this data, and afterwards, the system can identify and classify the species of an animal by taking an image of it.

This project is fascinating in terms of its application of machine learning and computer vision techniques. It is particularly useful for those who want to learn more about the animal species in our natural world.

## üåü Overview
The **Animal Species Detection** project leverages deep learning techniques to automatically classify animals in images. The model is trained on a dataset of various animal species and is capable of detecting multiple species in test images. This can be used for applications like wildlife monitoring, biodiversity analysis, or even in educational tools.

### Key Features
- Multi-class classification for animal species.
- Uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model implemented in TensorFlow/Keras.
- Can detect species like lions, elephants, tigers, bears, and more.
- Pre-trained model available for easy usage or further fine-tuning.

## üìö Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of animal images collected from open-source platforms such as Kaggle and Google Dataset Search. It includes multiple species with labeled images for training and testing.

## üìö Libraries Used

Here are the main libraries used in this project:

```python
import tensorflow as tf
import tensorflow_hub as hub
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
import requests
```

Additionally, the project uses a pre-trained model. Download the necessary label file using the following command:

```bash
!wget https://storage.googleapis.com/bit_models/ilsvrc2012_wordnet_lemmas.txt
```

This file contains the labels for animal species classification used with the pre-trained models.

## üß† Model Architecture
We use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for classifying animal species. The architecture is built using TensorFlow and Keras.

Key layers include:
- Convolutional layers for feature extraction.
- Max-pooling layers for down-sampling.
- Fully connected layers for classification.
- Softmax activation for multi-class output.

You can find the detailed architecture in the `notebooks/model.ipynb` file.
